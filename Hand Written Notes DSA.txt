DSA Notes (8:00pm - 9:30pm)
NOTE: 
	- class on every alternate days
	- practice questions You have to solve it
	- share with me on Discord/ Telegram/ Insta
	- if facing problems just connect with me
	- NO AI TOOLS TO CODE
	- full participation of students

---------- Class 1 (Into) -----------
Data is a information stored somewhere
Structure the process of organizing the things properly.

Data Structure: are diff ways of organizing data on your computer in such a way that can be used effeciently.

Eg:- 
	- 1. mesy way of bicks
	- 2. organized way of brikes (select)

so in order to work with data we have to fist orgamized it properly and then we can work with it in more efficient way.	

s/w point of view: 
	- efficiency 
	- performance
these things will rely of how you have stored, organized and grouped together during the program execution.

Daily life example:
	- students / people standing in queue for there turn (queue)
	- order in a restaurent


What is Algorithm?
	set of instructions to perform a task

eg:- 
	- driving a car
	- find the path b/w 2 points
	- withdraw the money from ATM
	- cooking a dish: 
		- what to cook (fry rice)
		- boil the rice
		- rince the excess water
		- prepare the chok
		- mix the rice with chok 
		- server it

make sure we will select the proper algo


computer science: it is a set of rules of a computer program to complet a task.

		Input Data
			|
			|
		calculation
			|
			|
	stop when we got the answer


we must Know when to use which algo for creating the memory and speed efficient program.

Foutune 500 : use some type of algo

Compression Algorithm: text, speech, audio, photo, video (Google and Facebook)
Graph Algorithm: to find the shortest path.


What makes a good algorithm?
	- Correctness
	- Efficiency


Why DSA is important?
	Because we have to process the data effeciently

input(data):
	- mon
	- tue
	- wed
	- thur
	- 50,45,35,49

process
	- arranging
	- sorting
	- combining
	- mathamatical operations

output(information):
	- temperature
	- mon - 50
	- tue - 45
	- wed - 35
	- thur - 49

our responsiblity is to optimize the process


eg: go to market to by the fruits
	input : set the location on map
	process: less Trafic, less time, fule efficient, no toll plaza
	output: base on the process and input we have done.

lib: we have book in organized way
maintance day: pile of books (diff to find a book)


Why compnaies ask the Question from DSA?
	- Judge your skills (ask the fundamentals of program)
	- Problam solving skills.
